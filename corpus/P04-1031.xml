		 Balancing Clarity and Efficiency in Typed Feature Logic through Delaying Gerald Penn University of Toronto 10 King’s College Rd. Toronto M5S 3G4 Canada gpenn@cs.toronto.edu Abstract The purpose of this paper is to re-examine the balance between clarity and efficiency in HPSG design , with particular reference to the design decisions made in the English Resource Grammar ( LinGO , 1999 , ERG ) .

		 It is argued that a simple generalization of the conventional delay statements used in logic programming is sufficient to restore much of the functionality and concomitant benefit that the ERG elected to forego , with an acceptable although still perceptible computational cost .

		 1 Motivation By convention , current HPSGs consist , at the very least , of a deductive backbone of extended phrase structure rules , in which each category is a description of a typed feature structure ( TFS ) , augmented with constraints that enforce the principles of grammar .

		 This included logic-programming-style relations ( H¨ohfeld and Smolka , 1988 ) , a powerful description language in which expressions could denote sets of TFSs through the use of an explicit disjunction operator , and the full expressive power of implications , in which antecedents of the above- mentioned 0 principles could be arbitrarily complex .

		 5 Conclusion It has been shown that a simple generalization of conventional delay statements to LTFS , combined with a subsumption-based interpretation of implicational constraints and unique feature introduction are sufficient to restore much of the functionality and concomitant benefit that has been routinely sacrificed in HPSG in the name of parsing efficiency .

	<s id="159">
		 While a definitive measurement of the computational cost of this functionality has yet to emerge , there is at least no apparent indication from the experiments that we can conduct that disjunction , complex antecedents and/or a judicious use of recursion pose a significant obstacle to tractable grammar design when the right control strategy ( CLP with subsumption testing ) is adopted .
