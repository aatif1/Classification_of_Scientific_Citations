	</s>
	

	<s id="19">
		 Acquiring the subcategorization frames for a verb involves , in the first place , distinguishing which constituents are its arguments and which are adjuncts , elements that give an additional piece of information to the sentence .

	<s id="20">
		 Moreover , sentences contain other constituents that are not included in the subcategorisation frames of verbs : these are sub-constituents that are not structurally attached to the verb , but to other constituents .

	<s id="23">
		 In order to collect the frequency distributions of Spanish subcategorisation frames , we adapt a methodology that has been developed for English to the specificities of the Spanish language (

	<s id="24">
		 It consists in extracting from the corpus pairs made of a verb and its co-occurring constituents that are a possible pattern of a frame , and then filtering out the patterns that do not have a probability of co- occurrence with the verb high enough to be considered its arguments .

	<s id="25">
		 We establish a set of 11 possible Spanish subcategorisation frames .

	<s id="26">
		 These are the plausible combinations of a maximum of 2 of the following constituents : nominal phrases , prepositional phrases , temporal sentential clauses , gerundive sentential clauses , infinitival sentential clauses , and infinitival sentential clauses introduced by a preposition .

	<s id="27">
		 The individual prepositions are also taken into account as part of the subcategorisation frame types . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="28">
		 Adapting a methodology that has been thought for English presents a few problems , because English is a language with a strong word order constraint , while in Spanish the order of constituents is freer .

	<s id="29">
		 Although the unmarked order of constituents is Subject Verb Object with the direct object preceding the indirect object , in naturally occurring language the constituents can be moved to non- canonical positions . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="30">
		 Since we extract the patterns from a partially parsed corpus , which has no information on the attachment or grammatical function of the constituents , we have to take into account that the extraction is an approximation . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="31">
		 There are various phenomena that can lead us to an erroneous extraction of the constituents . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="32">
		 As an illustrative example , in Spanish it is possible to have an inversion in the order of the objects , as can be observed in sentence ( 1 ) , where the indirect object a Straw ( “to Straw” ) precedes the direct object los alegatos ( “the pleas” ) .

		 Dealing with this kind of phenomenon introduces some noise in the data .

	<s id="36">
		 Matching a pattern for a subcategorisation frame from sentence ( 1 ) , for example , we would misleadingly induce the pattern [ PP(a) ] for the verb presentar , “present” , when in fact the correct pattern for this sentence is [ NP PP(a) ] . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="37">
		 The solution we adopt for dealing with the variations in the order of constituents is to take into account the functional information provided by clitics .

	<s id="38">
		 Clitics are unstressed pronouns that refer to an antecedent in the discourse . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="39">
		 In Spanish , clitic pronouns can only refer to the subject , the direct object , or the indirect object of the verb , and they can in most cases be disambiguated taking into account their agreement ( in person , number and gender ) with the verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="40">
		 When we find a clitic pronoun in a sentence , we know that an argument position is already filled by it , and the rest of the constituents that are candidates for the position are either discarded or moved to another position . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="41">
		 Sentence ( 2 ) shows an example of how the presence of clitic pronouns allows us to transform the patterns extracted . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="42">
		 The sentence would normally match with the frame pattern [ PP(por) ] , but the presence of the clitic ( which has the form le ) allows us to deduce that the sentence contains an indirect object , realised in the sub- categorisation pattern with a prepositional phrase headed by a in second position . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="43">
		 Therefore , we look for the following nominal phrase , la aparici´on del cad´aver , to fill the slot of the direct object , that otherwise would have not been included in the pattern .

		 The collection of pairs verb + pattern obtained with the method described in the last section needs to be filtered out , because we may have extracted constituents that are in fact adjuncts , or elements that are not attached to the verb , or errors in the extraction process .

		 On the contrary , the task of inducing semantic classes from syntactic information using a clustering algorithm leaves room for improvement . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="126">
		 The future work for this task goes on two directions . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="127">
		 On the one hand , the theoretical basis of the manual verb classification suggests that , although the syntactic behaviour of verbs is an important criteria for a semantic classification , other properties of the verbs should be taken into account . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="128">
		 Therefore , the description of verbs could be further enhanced with features that reflect on meaning components and event structure . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="129">
		 The incorporation of name entity recognition in the experiments reported here is a first step in this direction , but it is probably a too sparse feature in the data to make any significant contributions . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="130">
		 The event structure of predicates could be statistically approximated from text by grasping the aspect of the verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="131">
		 The aspect of the verbs could , in turn , be approximated by developing features that would consider the usage of certain tenses , or the presence of certain types of adverbs that imply a restriction on the aspect of the verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="132">
		 Adverbs such as ”suddenly” , ”continuously” , ”often” , or even adverbial sentences such as ”every day” give information on the event structure of predicates . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="133">
		 As they are a closed class of words , a typology of adverbs could be established to approximate the event structure of the verb

		 . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="134">
		 On the other hand , an observation of the verb clusters output by the algorithm suggests that they are intuitively more plausible than what the evaluation measures indicate . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="135">
		 For the purposes of possible applications , a hard clustering of verbs does not seem to be necessary , especially when even manually constructed classifications adopt arbitrary decisions and do not agree with each other : knowing which verbs are semantically similar to each other in a more “fuzzy” way might be even more useful . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="136">
		 For this reason , a new approach could be envisaged for this task , in the direction of the work by 
		<ref citStr="Weeds and Weir , 2003" id="22" label="CEPF" position="24042">
			( Weeds and Weir , 2003 )
		</ref>
		 , by building rankings of similarity for each verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="137">
		 For the purpose of evaluation , the gold standard classification could also be organised in the form of similarity rankings , based on the distance between the verbs in the hierarchy . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="138">
		 Then , the rankings for each verb could be evaluated . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="139">
		 The two directions appointed here , enriching the verb descriptions with new features that grasp other properties of the verbs , and envisaging a similarity ranking of verbs instead of a hard clustering , are the next steps to be taken for this work .
