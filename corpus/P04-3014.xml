		 Improving Bitext Word Alignments via Syntax-based Reordering of English Elliott Franco Dr´abek and David Yarowsky Department of Computer Science Johns Hopkins University Baltimore , MD 21218 , USA {edrabek,yarowsky}@cs.jhu.edu Abstract We present an improved method for automated word alignment of parallel texts which takes advantage of knowledge of syntactic divergences , while avoiding the need for syntactic analysis of the less resource rich language , and retaining the robustness of syntactically agnostic approaches such as the IBM word alignment models .

	<s id="2">
		 We achieve this by using simple , easily-elicited knowledge to produce syntax- based heuristics which transform the target language ( e.g. English ) into a form more closely resembling the source language , and then by using standard alignment methods to align the transformed bitext .

		 While the focus on major classes of structural variation such as manner-ofmotion verb-phrase transformations have facilitated both transfer and generation in machine translation , these divergences have not been integrated into a system that produces automatic word alignments and have tended to focus on more local phrasal variation rather than more comprehensive sentential syntactic reordering .
