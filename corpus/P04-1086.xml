		 Using Conditional Random Fields to Predict Pitch Accents in Conversational Speech Michelle L. Gregory Linguistics Department University at Buffalo Buffalo , NY 14260 mgregory@buffalo.edu Yasemin Altun Department of Computer Science Brown University Providence , RI 02912 altun@cs.brown.edu Abstract The detection of prosodic characteristics is an important aspect of both speech synthesis and speech recognition .

		 Correct placement of pitch accents aids in more natural sounding speech , while automatic detection of accents can contribute to better word- level recognition and better textual understanding .

	<s id="3">
		 In this paper we investigate probabilistic , contextual , and phonological factors that influence pitch accent placement in natural , conversational speech in a sequence labeling setting .

		 We introduce Conditional Random Fields ( CRFs ) to pitch accent prediction task in order to incorporate these factors efficiently in a sequence model .

		 1 Introduction The suprasegmental features of speech relay critical information in conversation .

	<s id="8">
		 Yet , one of the major roadblocks to natural sounding speech synthesis has been the identification and implementation of prosodic characteristics . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="9">
		 The difficulty with this task lies in the fact that prosodic cues are never absolute ; they are relative to individual speakers , gender , dialect , discourse context , local context , phonological environment , and many other factors . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="10">
		 This is especially true of pitch accent , the acoustic cues that make one word more prominent than others in an utterance . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="11">
		 For example , a word with a fundamental frequency ( f0 ) of 120 Hz would likely be quite prominent in a male speaker , but not for a typical female speaker . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="12">
		 Likewise , the accent on the utterance ”Jon’s leaving.” is critical in determining whether it is the answer to the question ”Who is leaving?” ( ”JON’s leaving.” ) or ”What is Jon doing?” ( ”Jon’s LEAVING.” ) .

	<s id="13">
		 Accurate pitch accent prediction lies in the successful combination of as many of the con- textual variables as possible .

		 In other words , a word that might typically be accented may be unaccented because the surrounding words also bear pitch accent .
