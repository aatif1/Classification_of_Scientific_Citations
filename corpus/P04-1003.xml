		 Many different experimental methodologies have been brought to bear on the study of this process , including visual and auditory lexical decision tasks ( e.g. , Meyer &amp; Schvaneveldt , 1971 ; Moss , Ostrin , Tyler &amp; Marslen-Wilson , 1995 ) , event-related brain potentials ( e.g. , Brown , Hagoort &amp; Chwilla , 2000 ) , and the recording of eye movements during normal reading .

		 The extensive literature concerned with contextual influences on lexical processing divides into three main strands : ( 1 ) lexical priming ( single- word contexts , where the prime-target relation is semantic or associative in nature ) ; ( 2 ) multiple priming ( two or more individual lexical primes ) ; and ( 3 ) contextual constraint ( the set of primes is structured by linguistic relationships with one another ) .

		 Because these effects are robust and apparently automatic , researchers often seek explanations in terms of low-level mechanisms such as spreading activation , compound-cue models ( Ratcliff &amp; McKoon , 1988 ) , and distributed neural network models ( Cree , McRae &amp; McNorgan , 1999 ; Plaut , 1995 ) .

		 This difference between the RU and HR conditions was statistically reliable : planned comparisons ( with suitable alpha corrections ) confirmed that all four conditions differed reliably from one other , at the a=0.05 level of significance .

		 Briefly , it appears that the discrepancy may be an artifact of the particular choice of experimental materials .

		 The larger simulated priming effect for the RU condition was probably due to the differences between the Prime-1 words and the Prime-2 words .

		 It is straightforward , given a large corpus and a sufficiently precise working hypothesis , to create sets of stimulus materials that should produce context effects , and to test them using human participants .

		 Because of the multiplicity of relevant linking relations evidenced by Hodgson , 1991 , this would be harder to do in a spreading activation framework . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="145">
		 Another avenue for exploration is to use the combination of ICE and the refined lexical relations encoded in WordNet to create materials that would allow a larger scale replication of the results of
