		 If we attempt to compensate for the poor precision by being less strict in filtering out less likely SCFs , then we will end up with a larger number of noisy lexical entries , which is problematic for parsing with lexicalized grammars

		 In order to show the effects of the use of the training SCFs , I also performed clustering of SCF confidence-value vectors in the acquired SCFs with random initialization ( k = 49 ( for XTAG ) and 53 ( for ERG ) ; centroid cut-off 0.05* ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="97">
		 The graph shows that clustering is meaningful only when we make use of the reliable SCFs in the manually-coded lexicon . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="98">
		 The centroid cutoff using the lexicon of the grammar boosted precision compared to the confidence cut-off . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="99">
		 The difference between the effects of my method on XTAG and ERG would be due to the finer-grained SCF types of ERG . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="100">
		 This resulted in lower precision of the acquired SCFs for ERG , which prevented us from distinguishing infrequent ( correct ) SCFs from SCFs acquired in error . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="101">
		 However , since unusual SCFs tend to be included in the lexicon , we will be able to have accurate clusters for unknown words with smaller SCF variations as we achieved in the experiments with XTAG .

		 5 Concluding Remarks and Future Work In this paper , I presented a method to improve the quality of SCFs acquired from corpora using existing lexicon resources . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="103">
		 I applied my method to SCFs acquired from corpora using lexicons of the XTAG English grammar and the LinGO ERG , and have shown that it can eliminate implausible SCFs , preserving more reliable SCFs . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="104">
		 In the future , I need to evaluate the quality of the resulting SCFs by manual analysis and by using the extended lexicons to improve parsing . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="105">
		 I will investigate other clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering , and use other information for clustering such as semantic preference of arguments of SCFs to have more accurate clusters .
