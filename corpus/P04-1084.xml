		 The move to MCSG is motivated by our desire to more perspicuously account for certain syntactic phenomena that cannot be easily captured by context-free grammars , such as clitic climbing , extraposition , and other types of long- distance movement

		 In MTG , synchronous rewriting is implemented by means of an indexing relation that is maintained over occurrences of nonterminals in a sentential form , using essentially the same machinery as SDTS .

	<s id="15">
		 Unlike SDTS , MTG can extend the dimensionality of the translation relation beyond two , and it can implement independent rewriting by means of partial deletion of syntactic structures .

	<s id="16">
		 Our proposal generalizes MTG by moving from component grammars that generate context- free languages to component grammars whose generative power is equivalent to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems ( LCFRS ) , a formalism for describing a class of MCSGs .

	<s id="17">
		 The generalization is achieved by allowing context-free productions to rewrite tuples of strings , rather than single strings .
