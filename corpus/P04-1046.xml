		 Building Verb Predicates : A Computational View Fernando Gomez Dept. of Computer Science University of Central Florida , Orlando , FL 32816 gomez@cs.ucf.edu Abstract A method for the definition of verb predicates is proposed . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="2">
		 The definition of the predicates is essentially tied to a semantic interpretation algorithm that determines the predicate for the verb , its semantic roles and adjuncts . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="3">
		 As predicate definitions are complete , they can be tested by running the algorithm on some sentences and verifying the resolution of the predicate , semantic roles and adjuncts in those sentences . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="4">
		 The predicates are defined semiautomatically with the help of a software environment that uses several sections of a corpus to provide feedback for the definition of the predicates , and then for the subsequent testing and refining of the definitions . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="5">
		 The method is very flexible in adding a new predicate to a list of already defined predicates for a given verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="6">
		 The method builds on an existing approach that defines predicates for WordNet verb classes , and that plans to define predicates for every English verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="7">
		 The definitions of the predicates and the semantic interpretation algorithm are being used to automatically create a corpus of annotated verb predicates , semantic roles and adjuncts . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="8">
		 1 Introduction This paper deals with the definition of verb predicates which will make possible the determination of verb meaning , semantic roles , adjuncts , and attachment and meaning of post- verbal PPs . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="9">
		 Hence , the adequacy of the definitions is measured by comparing the output of a semantic interpretation algorithm with the solution of those semantic interpretation tasks on sentences randomly taken from any corpus , or typed by a user at the console .

	<s id="10">
		 The algorithm , thus , must provide immediate feedback by testing the definitions on these randomly selected sentences .

	<s id="12">
		 The semantic roles of the predicates are linked to the selectional restrictions ( categories in WordNet ontology for nouns ) and the grammatical relations that realize them . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="13">
		 The selectional restrictions of the predicates are solidly grounded on the WordNet ontology for nouns

		 based on the feedback obtained by testing the predicate definitions . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="14">
		 However , we have found out that the initial idea in that work of defining predicates for a WN verb class which will be also valid for most of the verbs under that class has proven to be too optimistic because many of the verb forms included under that class realize their semantic roles by different selectional restrictions and grammatical relations . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="15">
		 This is due to the fact that many of the verbs under a given class have been grouped in many instances by some kind of implication , or troponymy 
		<ref citStr="Fellbaum , 1998" id="5" label="CEPF" position="3110">
			( Fellbaum , 1998 )
		</ref>
		 , rather that by sharing semantic roles in a hierarchy of predicates . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="16">
		 Even in many cases , some of the verbs in the same synset list differ semantically and syntactically between them . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="17">
		 For instance , the third sense of &quot; gain &quot; in WN is : &quot; profit , gain , benefit ( derive benefit from ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="18">
		 &quot; The theme , the thing obtained , is syntactically realized by the PP [ from NP ] for two of the verbs listed in that synset &quot; benefit &quot; and &quot; profit , &quot; while the theme for &quot; gain &quot; is realized by a direct object . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="19">
		 The differences in grammatical relations are even more prevailing within the verbs under one given class . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="20">
		 But , in those cases in which the verb polysemy is not high , one predicate definition for the verb class may apply to many of the verb forms under that class . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="21">
		 Notwithstanding these problems , WN verb classes have provided an important basis for the construction of a general ontology of predicates that will cover every English verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="22">
		 Moreover , if one considers that there are 5752 verbs in WordNet 1.6 having only one sense and 2199 verbs having exactly two senses , the pred- icates that have been constructed for the verb classes of 7,951 verbs are very close to be done . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="23">
		 However , the method explained in this paper deviates considerably from the WN approach to constructing verb meaning . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="24">
		 In particular , it eschews the synset list in favor of predicate definitions for individual verbs as opposed to a list of synonymous verbs , and allows for an easy integration of a new predicate into a list of already defined predicates for a given verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="25">
		 Briefly , the algorithm 
		<ref citStr="Gomez , 2001" id="6" label="CEPF" position="4812">
			( Gomez , 2001 )
		</ref>
		 that tests the predicates is as follows . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="26">
		 For every verb in a sentence , we provide a list of predicates for that verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="27">
		 These predicates can be viewed as contenders for the meaning of the verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="28">
		 The goals of the algorithm are to select one predicate from that list , thus determining the sense of the verb , identify its semantic roles , and adjuncts and attach post-verbal PPs . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="29">
		 All these tasks are simultaneously achieved . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="30">
		 For each grammatical relation ( GR ) in the clause ( starting with the NP complements ) and for every predicate in the list of predicates , the algorithm checks if the predicate explains the GR . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="31">
		 A predicate explains a GR if there is a semantic role in the predicate realized by the grammatical relation and the selectional restrictions of the semantic role subsume the ontological category of the head noun of the grammatical relation . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="32">
		 This process is repeated for each GR in the clause and each predicate in the list of predicates for the verb of the clause . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="33">
		 Then , the predicate that explains the most GRs is selected as the meaning of the verb . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="34">
		 The semantic roles of the predicate have been identified as a result of this process . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="35">
		 In case of ties , the predicate that has the greatest number of semantic roles realized is selected . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="36">
		 Every grammatical relation that has not been mapped to a semantic role must be an adjunct or an NP modifier . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="37">
		 The entries for adjuncts are stored in the root node action or description ( for stative verbs ) and are inherited by all predicates in those categories .

	<s id="39">
		 In the next section , we will show how to define predicates for individual verbs as different from WN verb classes , how these predicates for individual verbs can reuse entries in the generic predicates for WordNet verb classes , and how they are integrated into the ontology of predicates that have been defined with the help of WN verb classes .

		 2 Defining Predicates for Individual Verbs The approach to defining predicates for individual verbs is similar to the way in which the senses for a verb are given in a dictionary . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="43">
		 The difference lies in the level of detail provided . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="44">
		 For each verb sense , one must provide : a ) a predicate and a hierarchy where to insert it , b ) the semantic roles for the predicate , and c ) the selectional restrictions and grammatical relations for each role . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="45">
		 Of course , in the construction of the definitions one must keep in mind the interpretation algorithm because the definitions must determine verb meaning , semantic roles and adjuncts . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="46">
		 Except for that , our approach is similar to a dictionary definition in the sense that the predicates for that verb are listed in the same way as the senses of a verb are listed in the dictionary . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="47">
		 The lexical definition of the predicates is a frame-like representation containing the selectional restrictions followed by the grammatical relations for that role given those selectional restrictions . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="48">
		 The syntax for a semantic role is : ( role ( ( &lt;slr&gt; ) ( &lt;grs&gt; ) ( &lt;slr&gt; ) ( &lt;grs&gt; ) ( &lt;slr&gt; ( &lt;grs&gt; ) ) ) ) Where &lt; slr &gt; stands for any number of selectional restrictions , and &quot; &lt; grs &gt; &quot; for any number of grammatical relations . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="49">
		 The order in which the grammatical relations are listed is irrelevant . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="50">
		 However , the order of the selectional restrictions is relevant in the sense that the first selectional restriction that matches is selected and the others in the list are not tried . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="51">
		 Hence , the list of selectional restrictions is a preference list

		</ref>
		 .

	<s id="52">
		 This preference list is critical in selecting the correct sense for many head nouns in the noun phrases of the verb arguments . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="53">
		 A selectional restriction preceded by the sign &quot; - &quot; ( -slr ) means that the semantic role is not realized by that ontological category . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="54">
		 The grammatical relations for PPs are represented by writing &quot; prep &quot; followed by the prepositions that realize the semantic role , e.g. ( prep about on ... ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="55">
		 Some of the grammatical relations are : subj ( the sentence has a subject ) , subj-if-obj ( the sentence has a subject and a direct object ) , obj ( direct object ) , obj2 ( second post- verbal NP ) , cp ( any complement clause ) , cpinf ( an infinitival complement clause ) , cp-thatclause ( a complement clause introduced by a that clause ) , cp-ing ( a complement clause introduced by gerund ) , prep-cp ( a complement clause introduced by a preposition ) , etc. .

	<s id="56">
		 Suppose that one wants to define predicates for the verb &quot; gain .

	</s>
	

	<s id="58">
		 The reason for putting them is to produce an output that can be checked against WN verb senses ( see Section 5 ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="59">
		 We could have also included the sense numbers of Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English ( Longman Group , UK Limited ) , one of the dictionaries that we have consulted in constructing the predicates .

	<s id="60">
		 The first predicate gain-weight is a subpredicate of cchange-state-of-animate , cause-change-of-stateof-animate-being , which has been already defined for a class of WN verbs .

		 &quot; Order of the Predicates As indicated , the order of the predicates is relevant in the sense that , in case of ties ( two or more predicates realize all their semantic roles ) , they will be preferred as the predicate for that verb in the order in which they are defined .

		 &quot; If the ontological category of the selectional restriction of at least one role , says , rl , in predicate , say , pi , is not in the same path as the selectional restriction of role rl in predicate pi , then it makes no difference in which order the predicates are defined .

	<s id="99">
		 For instance , if one types the sentence &quot; the kite flew into the sky , &quot; the system selects two predicates for &quot; fly &quot; : the first one : fly which is a subpredicate of change-location , ( an animate being changes location from a place to another ) .
