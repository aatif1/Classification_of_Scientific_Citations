Brief description of creation:
==============================
We took the plain text files from the ACL ARC [1] and use the
sentence splitting that is part of TreeTagger [2], which
marks the sentence boundaries with opening and closing XML tags.  We
then use a regular expression to find the citations in the text and
similarly mark them up with XML, resulting in a very simple XML file
with sentence and citation tags.  When annotating and building the
corpus then, we simply add the annotation label as an attribute to the
marked up citation.

TODO:
Convert corpus to TEI P5 format [3]
