		 Extending the BLEU MT Evaluation Method with Frequency Weightings Bogdan Babych Anthony Hartley Centre for Translation Studies Centre for Translation Studies University of Leeds University of Leeds Leeds , LS2 9JT , UK Leeds , LS2 9JT , UK bogdan@comp.leeds.ac.uk a.hartley@leeds.ac.uk Abstract We present the results of an experiment on extending the automatic method of Machine Translation evaluation BLUE with statistical weights for lexical items , such as tf.idf scores . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="2">
		 We show that this extension gives additional information about evaluated texts ; in particular it allows us to measure translation Adequacy , which , for statistical MT systems , is often overestimated by the baseline BLEU method . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="3">
		 The proposed model uses a single human reference translation , which increases the usability of the proposed method for practical purposes . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="4">
		 The model suggests a linguistic interpretation which relates frequency weights and human intuition about translation Adequacy and Fluency .

		 1. Introduction Automatic methods for evaluating different aspects of MT quality – such as Adequacy , Fluency and Informativeness – provide an alternative to an expensive and time-consuming process of human MT evaluation . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="6">
		 They are intended to yield scores that correlate with human judgments of translation quality and enable systems ( machine or human ) to be ranked on this basis . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="7">
		 Several such automatic methods have been proposed in recent years . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="8">
		 Some of them use human reference translations , e.g. , the BLEU method

			( Papineni et al. , 2002 )
		</ref>
		 , which is based on comparison of N-gram models in MT output and in a set of human reference translations . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="9">
		 However , a serious problem for the BLEU method is the lack of a model for relative importance of matched and mismatched items . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="10">
		 Words in text usually carry an unequal informational load , and as a result are of differing importance for translation . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="11">
		 It is reasonable to expect that the choices of right translation equivalents for certain key items , such as expressions denoting principal events , event participants and relations in a text are more important in the eyes of human evaluators then choices of function words and a syntactic perspective for sentences . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="12">
		 Accurate rendering of these key items by an MT system boosts the quality of translation . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="13">
		 Therefore , at least for evaluation of translation Adequacy ( Fidelity ) , the proper choice of translation equivalents for important pieces of information should count more than the choice of words which are used for structural purposes and without a clear translation equivalent in the source text . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="14">
		 ( The latter may be more important for Fluency evaluation ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="15">
		 The problem of different significance of N- gram matches is related to the issue of legitimate variation in human translations , when certain words are less stable than others across independently produced human translations . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="16">
		 BLEU accounts for legitimate translation variation by using a set of several human reference translations , which are believed to be representative of several equally acceptable ways of translating any source segment . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="17">
		 This is motivated by the need not to penalise deviations from the set of N- grams in a single reference , although the requirement of multiple human references makes automatic evaluation more expensive . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="18">
		 However , the “significance” problem is not directly addressed by the BLEU method . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="19">
		 On the one hand , the matched items that are present in several human references receive the same weights as items found in just one of the references . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="20">
		 On the other hand the model of legitimate translation variation cannot fully accommodate the issue of varying degrees of “salience” for matched lexical items , since alternative synonymic translation equivalents may also be highly significant for an adequate translation from the human perspective

	</s>
	

	<s id="21">
		 Therefore it is reasonable to suggest that introduction of a model which approximates intuitions about the significance of the matched N-grams will improve the correlation between automatically computed MT evaluation scores and human evaluation scores for translation Adequacy .

		 The proposed weighted N-gram model for MT evaluation is tested on a set of translations by four different MT systems available in the DARPA corpus , and is compared with the results of the baseline BLEU method with respect to their correlation with human evaluation scores .

	<s id="25">
		 The scores produced by the N-gram model with tf.idf and S-Score weights are shown to be consistent with baseline BLEU evaluation results for Fluency and outperform the BLEU scores for Adequacy ( where the correlation for the S-score weighting is higher ) .

	<s id="26">
		 We also show that the weighted model may still be reliably used if there is only one human reference translation for an evaluated text . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="27">
		 Besides saving cost , the ability to dependably work with a single human translation has an additional advantage : it is now possible to create Recall-based evaluation measures for MT , which has been problematic for evaluation with multiple reference translations , since only one of the choices from the reference set is used in translation ( Papineni et al . 2002:314 ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="28">
		 Notably , Recall of weighted N-grams is found to be a good estimation of human judgements about translation Adequacy . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="29">
		 Using weighted N-grams is essential for predicting Adequacy , since correlation of Recall for non-weighted N-grams is much lower . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="30">
		 It is possible that other automatic methods which use human translations as a reference may also benefit from an introduction of an explicit model for term significance , since so far these methods also implicitly assume that all words are equally important in human translation , and use all of them , e.g. , for measuring edit distances ( Akiba et al , 2001 ; 2003 ) .

	</s>
	

	<s id="105">
		 Also from the linguistic point of view , S-score weights and N-grams may only be reasonably good approximations of Adequacy , which involves a wide range of factors , like syntactic and semantic issues that cannot be captured by N- gram matches and require a thesaurus and other knowledge-based extensions .

		 The proposed evaluation method also preserves the ability of BLEU to consistently predict scores for Fluency : Precision weighted by tf.idf scores has the strongest positive correlation with this aspect of MT quality , which is slightly better than the values for BLEU ; ( S-score : r(2)= 0.9912 , p&lt;0.01 ; r(2)= 0.9769 , p&lt;0.05 ; tf. idf score : r(2)= 0.9987 , p&lt;0.001 ; r(2)= 0.9998 , p&lt; 0.001 ) .

		 On the one hand using 1 human reference with uniform results is essential for our methodology , since it means that there is no more “trouble with Recall” ( Papineni et al. , 2002:314 ) – a system’s ability to avoid under-generation of N-grams can now be reliably measured .

	<s id="113">
		 The fact that non-weighted F-scores also have high correlation with Fluency suggests a new linguistic interpretation of the nature of these two quality criteria : it is intuitively plausible that Fluency subsumes , i.e. presupposes Adequacy ( similarly to the way the F-score subsumes Recall , which among all other scores gives the best correlation with Adequacy ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="114">
		 The non-weighted F- score correlates more strongly with Fluency than either of its components : Precision and Recall ; similarly Adequacy might make a contribution to Fluency together with some other factors .

		 It is conceivable that people need adequate translations ( or at least translations that make sense ) in order to be able to make judgments about naturalness , or Fluency .

	<s id="116">
		 Being able to make some sense out of a text could be the major ground for judging Adequacy : sensible mistranslations in MT are relatively rare events .

	<s id="117">
		 This may be the consequence of a principle similar to the “second law of thermodynamics” applied to text structure , – in practice it is much rarer to some alternative sense to be created ( even if the number of possible error types could be significant ) , than to destroy the existing sense in translation , so the majority of inadequate translations are just nonsense .
