		 1 Introduction Context-free grammars ( CFGs ) are standardly used in computational linguistics as formal models of the syntax of natural language , associating sentences with all their possible derivations .

		 Other computational models with the same generative capacity as CFGs are also adopted , as for instance push-down automata ( PDAs ) . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="6">
		 One of the advantages of the use of PDAs is that these devices provide an operational specification that determines which steps must be performed when parsing an input string , something that is not offered by CFGs .

	<s id="7">
		 In other words , PDAs can be associated to parsing strategies for context- free languages .

	<s id="8">
		 More precisely , parsing strategies are traditionally specified as constructions that map CFGs to language-equivalent PDAs .
