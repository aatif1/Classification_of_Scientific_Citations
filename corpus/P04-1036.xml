		 Finding Predominant Word Senses in Untagged Text Diana McCarthy &amp; Rob Koeling &amp; Julie Weeds &amp; John Carroll Department of Informatics , University of Sussex Brighton BN1 9QH , UK dianam,robk,juliewe,johnca @sussex.ac.uk Abstract In word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) , the heuristic of choosing the most common sense is extremely powerful because the distribution of the senses of a word is often skewed .

	<s id="2">
		 The problem with using the predominant , or first sense heuristic , aside from the fact that it does not take surrounding context into account , is that it assumes some quantity of hand- tagged data . 
	</s>
	

	<s id="3">
		 Whilst there are a few hand-tagged corpora available for some languages , one would expect the frequency distribution of the senses of words , particularly topical words , to depend on the genre and domain of the text under consideration .

		 We present work on the use of a thesaurus acquired from raw textual corpora and the WordNet similarity package to find predominant noun senses automatically .

		 The acquired predominant senses give a precision of 64 % on the nouns of the SENSEVAL2 English all-words task .

		 This is a very promising result given that our method does not require any hand-tagged text , such as SemCor .
